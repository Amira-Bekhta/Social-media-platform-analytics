# 📊 Social media platform data analytics project
Hello! This is my first ever data analytics project! I am so excited for you to see it and give me feedback about it!

# 🕵️‍♂️ Scenario
This is an imaginary social media platform that has provided us with 3 datasets, users.csv, posts.csv, and ads.csv

# 🎯 Goals
The goals of this project are to answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What posts to suggest to each user based on their interests?</li>
<li>What ads to display in each location based on the common interests there?</li>
<li>What are the ideal time ranges to post in the platform and get more interaction?</li>
<li>What promoting platforms have made us receive more users?</li>
</ul>

# 📂 Folder structure
<b>Analytics:</b> This folder contains all the jupyter notebooks that were used to answer the previous question
<b>Data:</b> This folder contains the datasets used to perform the analysis
<b>Visualizations:</b> This folder contains the plot chart generated in each analysis 

# 🛠️ Tools used
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>

# 📚 Things I learned
While working in this project, I have discovered many new things such as:

<ul>
<li>Using <code>bins</code> and <code>labels</code> to group time intervals</li>
<li>Using <code>drop=True</code> while resetting index after dropping some rows to get the index ordered again</li>
<li>Using <code>plt.savefig()</code> before using <code>plt.show()</code> to make sure that the picture of the chart is correctly displayed</li>
<li>Using <code>Seaborn.color_palette()</code> While generating a <code>Matplotlib</code> chart to make it more customizable</li>
</ul>

This and a lot more have made the project really helpful as I practiced and improved my data analytics knowledge

# 🚀 Using this repository
Download/clone the repository in your local machine and make sure that <code>pandas</code>, <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>, and <code>seaborn</code> packages are installed, you can do this using pip or conda:


For <code>pip</code>, use this command: <code>pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn</code>
For <code>conda</code>, activate your environement and run this command: <code>conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn</code>

# 💡 How you can help me
As you have read, this was my first ever project, this is why it may lack of better documentation, as well as better formatting and use for the different functions, this is why I would be more than happy to receive any feedback and understand how to make this project more enhanced





## ⚠️ The csv datasets used here were generate by AI, and they were only made for leanring and practice purposes
